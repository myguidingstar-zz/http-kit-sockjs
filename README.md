# Methojure SockJs Package

This is a sockjs implementation on top of the [http-kit](http://http-kit.org/) server.

## Server

On the server the `methojure.sockjs.session.SockjsConnection` protocol must be implemented.
Here is simple echo implementation. Make sure the each method returns the session object.

```
(use 'methojure.sockjs.session)

(defrecord EchoConnection []
  SockjsConnection

  ;; on open is call whenever a new session is initiated.
  (on-open [this session] session)

  ;; on message is call when a new message arrives at the server.
  (on-message [this session msg]
    (send! session {:type :msg :content msg}))

  ;; when a connection closes this method is called
  (on-close [this session] session))
```

Next we can create an compojure handler:

```
(use 'compojure.core 'methojure.sockjs.core)

(defroutes my-routes
  (GET "/" [] "hello world")
  (sockjs-handler "/echo" (->EchoConnection) {:response-limit 4096}))
```

We are now ready to run a http-kit server:

```
(use 'org.httpkit.server 'ring.middleware.params)

(run-server (-> my-routes (wrap-params)) {:port 8000})
```

__NOTE:__ Please do not forget the ring `params` middleware.


## Testing

The server is tested with the [Sockjs-Protocol](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol)
test suite. Running `lein test` will automatically check out the repository, start the
server and run the suite. Currently not all test pass. Some will fail because the test suite
uses different Websocket protocol implementation that do not work with http-kit.

For development you can start the server with
`lein run -m methojure.sockjs.test.protocol-test-server` and execute the test manually with
`./target/sockjs-protocol/venv/bin/python ./target/sockjs-protocol/sockjs-protocol-0.3.3.py`.

For more info and all requirements to execute the test have a look at the
[Sockjs-Protocol](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol) test suite repository.


## TODOs
* Clojurescript wrapper around the sockjs client
* Fix remaining server tests or validate that they do not have to pass
